-- EMERGENCY FIX: Simple approach to get forms working immediately
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Completely disable RLS (removes all security temporarily)
ALTER TABLE contact_submissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Grant full access to public/anon role
GRANT ALL ON contact_submissions TO anon, public;
GRANT ALL ON subscriptions TO anon, public;

-- Step 3: Test with a simple insert (optional - you can skip this)
-- INSERT INTO contact_submissions (full_name, work_email, implementation_areas)
-- VALUES ('Test User', 'test@test.com', ARRAY['Sales']);

-- This should make forms work immediately
-- Once working, we can add security back properly
